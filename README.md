To run the script, make sure you have Ruby installed on your system. The script requires two input files: a text file containing a list of sensitive field names (one per line) and a JSON file containing the user data to be scrubbed. Save the provided Ruby code as scrub.rb and make it executable with chmod +x scrub.rb.

To execute the script, use the following command in your terminal:

bash

./scrub.rb sensitive_fields.txt input.json

Replace sensitive_fields.txt with the path to your sensitive fields text file and input.json with the path to your JSON file containing the data you want to scrub. The script will output a scrubbed JSON object with sensitive fields replaced according to the specified rules.
